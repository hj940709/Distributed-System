lamport clocks

	happened before
		same computer: a -> b ---the local clock,time never backwards
		2 computers
			messages: send->receive

	alogrithm:
		timestamp t;
		local event: t++ or t+=x
		sender: M(t), send message with the timestamp, t++
		receiver: M(t') and t, take t'=max(t,t')+1


A:1,2,3,4,5,6(send message to B)...19,20,21(receive message from B)
B:1, , , , , ,7(receive message from B),8,9,10(send message to A)

a -> B => L(a)<L(b),a's timestamp is smaller than b's
 however L(a)<L(b) may not mean anything
