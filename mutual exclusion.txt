guarantee only one user can access to resources


Ricart-agrawala
nodes all runs lamport clock
node sends a message to ask if others need to access the resources
	if receives ok from all, go ahead.
	if not, compare the timestamp
		if there are same timestamp, compare the PID(node id in the system)
if one is using the resource, it will delay it ack message

Safety:If one node want to use the resources, it has to collect n-1 ack
Liveness:The comparison of PID 
Fairness:timestamps comparison
